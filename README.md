# Champions League Simulation using ELO Ratings
This project simulates the outcome of the UEFA Champions League based on ELO ratings, visualizing the progression of teams from the group stage to the final using a Python-based simulation. The new format of the Champions League is taken into account.

## Project Overview
The UEFA Champions League is introducing a new format for the 2024/25 season, making predictions more complex and more interesting for data-driven analysis. In this project, we'll explore how the ELO rating system can be used to simulate match outcomes and estimate the likelihood of each team advancing through the tournament. From assigning initial ratings to running simulations for every stage, his project offers a deep dive into how statistical modeling can provide insights into one of the world's most popular competitions.
